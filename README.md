# Louis-Module-18-NoSQL
## Description
I've been tasked with building an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
It uses express.js and mongodb packages. My server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database when I enter the command to invoke the application.
The data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON when I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts.
I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database when I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia.
I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list when I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia.
Lastly, I made sure to leave the code better than I found it.
